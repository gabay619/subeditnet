A simple tool to add or remove time to a SRT subtitle file.
I developed this in my spare time, so don't expect it to be completely bug free.
Please always BACKUP your **.srt file ;)**

You will need Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 to execute it on older Operating Systems.

If you got any Suggestions, Feature Requests or you see a bug, please do not hesitate to contact me: nerom86@googlemail.com

If you would like to donate, click on the "donate" button which you will find when on the Info Menu Strip. Any amount which covers the PayPal Cost is appreciated ;)
